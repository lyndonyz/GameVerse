# GameVerse
## GameVerse Web Application for Software Architecture 

Node Version: v24.11.0.<br>Make sure you have Visual Studio Code btw.

## For WINDOWS: 
Use Chocolatey v2.5.1.
<br>Read how to install Chocolatey on their official documentation for proper installation of node.js
<br>Ensure you have node installed.

Check using:
```node -v```
<br>Also check if npm is working and check:
```npm -v```

Make a new Directory called 4471 somewhere.
<br>Navigate into 4471.
<br>Clone the Repo to your local machine. Use HTTPS cloning.

Should look like:
<br>/4471/GameVerse/(the other folder/files)

Once you clone the repo, navigate into **GameVerse** folder.
<br>Then navigate into the **web** folder and do: 
```npm install```
<br>Navigate out of the **web** folder and navigate into the **server** folder and do: 
```npm install```
<br>Navigate back out into the **GameVerse** folder and do 
```npm install```

Once done, you should be able to run the web application locally using: 
```npm run dev```

Its running Vite + React + Express.
<br>If it doesn't work btw msg me guys: Luki

## Using Visual Studio Code to Push Stuff

I think it should be pretty obvious, but I'll write this just in case.

Go to Visual Studio Code -> File -> Open Folder -> Select 4471 Folder.
<br>Visual Studio Code will then prompt you if you trust this Author or whatever, just say yes.

Any changes you make will appear on the left side, with the branch icon (the lines with 3 circles).
<br>To commit and push, just click the + symbols on the files you want to commit, and write the message on the top to comment what you did.

**WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT COMMIT ANY NODE_MODULE FILES, AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE IS WORKING ON A FILE WHEN YOU COMMIT.**
<br>**ALSO DO NOT COMMIT THE API KEY OR WE WILL GET DESTROYED BY RAWG.IO**

Message in the group chat if we are working on a specific file etc.

Thats about it. Any questions, as before message me, 
<br>Luki
